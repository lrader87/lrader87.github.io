  <h1>Why I love living in Madison!</h1>

  <h2>Our beautiful campus</h2>

  <p>The background is a photo I took last year while standing on frozen Lake Mendota. You can see the Capital, the Red Gym, Memorial Union, and if you look close you can see lady liberty's head.

  <h2>Meeting awesome people</h2>

  <p>People come from all around the world to study here, which has allowed me to meet and learn from so many amazing people. I am also a part of UW's Formula SAE racing team, which has been a great experience to be a part of.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to learn more about the team, here is a link to our website: <a href="https://www.wisconsinracing.org/" target="_blank"> https://www.wisconsinracing.org/</a></p>

  <h2>Everything else</h2>

  <p>There are a million things to do in Madison, it would be impossible to list them all!</p>
